                <div class="about-box">
                <p>  Donkey Kong-inspired video game which I named "Surviving the Wild" was created in an assingment from a course taken in Winter 2023 at University of Calgary on the Raspberry Pi using the C programming language. There are four stages in the game, and each one has a different level. There is also a main screen and final screen as well as a collection of difficult obstacles. The addition of fire and coin aspects, which have a direct impact on the player's life total and provide another layer of strategy, improved the gaming mechanics. The game uses the SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) controller and the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) interface to enable responsive and fluid controls. Writing crucial functions during the development stage was necessary to handle the user's interactions with the game and ensure that the playing experience is smooth. </p>

                <div class="about-box">
                  <p>The SENG (Software Engineering) project undertaken in 2023 involved the development of a self-checkout system using a graphical user interface (GUI) in Java. A team collaborated on this project to ensure that the self-checkout system met the specific needs and use cases of the customers.

                    To ensure the quality and functionality of the system, rigorous coding unit tests were conducted. These tests aimed to cover a high percentage of the code, ensuring that different components of the system were thoroughly checked and any potential issues were identified and addressed. The unit tests played a crucial role in validating the correctness of the code and increasing the overall reliability of the self-checkout system.
                    
                    In addition to the coding aspect, a structure diagram was created and submitted as part of the project documentation. This diagram served as a visual representation of the system architecture, illustrating how different modules and components of the self-checkout system interacted with each other. The structure diagram helped in providing a clear understanding of the overall system design and facilitated communication among the team members and stakeholders involved in the project.
